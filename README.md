# Freaky-Admin-Menu-Roblox-Script
StupidII's Freaky Admin Menu is now out.
# And it's being tested.
Right now you have a chance to become an admin!
# How to:
Install Synapse X (Roblox executors, you can also use Delta.. I guess.).
I recommend Delta, it's free, while Synapse X is paid. https://delta-executor.com/ is the official website.
Go to Execute section for the script!
# Execute
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gititgit1113/Freaky-Admin-Menu-Roblox-Script/main/FreakyAdminMenuByStupidII.lua"))()
```
